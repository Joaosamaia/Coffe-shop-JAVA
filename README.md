## About <a name = "about"></a>
In this study project, I used the old, but not dead, build style with Maven, employing JPA for data access, and Hibernate as the JPA implementation on a PostgreSQL database. The objective of the project is to build a system that could be used by a real coffee shop and its employees, aiming to understand and apply OOP concepts and the DAO pattern while achieving full database control through a simple and user-friendly Terminal UI. The project is originally written in my native language (BR portuguese) since it was a college assignment, but i can be easily translated to english (or any language) with the use of keywords (such as Client, Product, Stock, Supplier and etc).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
If you'd like to download or use this code, feel free to do so, you'll need a few things, but it's a project of very easy implementation, just dont forget to change the persistence.xml inside the META-INF folder.
### Prerequisites
- JavaSDK;
- An IDE of your choice;
- PostgreSQL (you may implement it with other databases, if you desire);
- Recomend using DBeaver for database visualization;

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
To use the system after configuring it with your database, you just need to run the main class and access the terminal from your IDE, the rest is very user-friendly.
